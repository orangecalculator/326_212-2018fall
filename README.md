## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Basic programming skills using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org)
- Proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore data using R
- Utilize contemporary R packages, especially the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
- Visualize, present, and communicate trends in a variety of data types
- Formulate data-driven hypotheses using exploratory data analysis and introductory model building techniques

## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Attendence** (10%): Includes both the lecture and the lab sessions.
- **Assignments** (30%): You will be assigned a computational assignment to be completed using RStudio and the package *knitr* regularly throughout class. 
- **Quizes** (20%): Unscheduled quizes will be frequently given throughout the class during the lab sessions.
- **Midterm and final projects** (40%): Each project will be a computational case study that brings together the techniques learned throughout the semester. The descriptions for projects will be provided towards the midpoint of the semester.

### Schedule

Overall, this course will be split into two main parts: (1) lecture sessions on the basics of how to code in R and (2) lab sessions for performing hands-on data analysis on real case studies and examples using R.

The following schedule is tentative, and is subject to change over the course.

| Week | Topic | Reading | Assignment | Due Date |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| w | t   | r   | a   | d   |
