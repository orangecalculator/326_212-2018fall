## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- acquire basic programming skills using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org);
- proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore data using R;
- utilize contemporary R packages, especially the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org);
- visualize, present, and communicate trends in a variety of data types;
- formulate data-driven hypotheses using exploratory data analysis and introductory model building techniques.

## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Attendence** (10%): Includes both the lecture and the lab sessions.
- **Assignments** (30%): You will be assigned a computational assignment to be completed using RStudio and the package *knitr* regularly throughout class. 
- **Quizes** (20%): Unscheduled quizes will be frequently given throughout the class during the lab sessions.
- **Midterm and final projects** (40%): Each project will be a computational case study that brings together the techniques learned throughout the semester. The descriptions for projects will be provided towards the midpoint of the semester.

### Schedule

Overall, this course will be split into two main parts: (1) lecture sessions on the basics of how to code in R and (2) lab sessions for performing hands-on data analysis on real case studies and examples using R.

The following schedule is tentative, and is subject to change over the course.
